Description:
This webpage was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and JQuery Mobile. It allows users to input his/her API key and ZIP code to get a 5-day/3-hour weather forecast from the Open Weather Map web service. Javascript handles the user's inputs and creates a request to retrieve the data using JQuery and AJAX. Jquery is used to change HTML DOM elements based on the user's inputs and the Open Weather Map web service response.

Instructions:
Before using the web page, make sure that the following files are in the same directory: sk3665_HW2.html, styles.css, forecast.js, and OpenWeatherMap.png. First, open sk3665_HW2.html with a web browser of choice. Then, enter API key and ZIP code and click the "Retrieve" button. To avoid error messages, a valid API key and ZIP code must be inputted.
