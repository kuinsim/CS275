Description:
The files and code make up a client-server app to request, process, and display results for a variety of simple mathematical calculations, in particular: n-Factorial and Summation series (add all integers from 1 to n). 

Instructions:
Before using the client-server app, make sure that node.js and express are installed. First, use a command line such as Command Prompt and change the current working directory to the one that contains these files. Once at the correct directory, run the command "node server.js". After that, open a web browser of choice and type "localhost:8080/sk3665_HW3.html" into the URL. From there, you can enter various inputs and select between the two different calculations and press the button. To avoid an error message, you must input a positive integer before pressing the button.
